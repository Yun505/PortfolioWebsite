        <p>I initiated a project with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of OCaml while simultaneously delving into the creation of my own SAT solver. My inspiration for this endeavor stemmed from chance encounters with a few informative slides online. It all started when a friend of mine mentioned the potential of "solving" my Math Foundations of Computer Science homework using a SAT solver, which intrigued me greatly. The notion of building my own solver seemed not only fascinating but also a rewarding way to explore the capabilities of OCaml.</p>
