        <p>The game was designed with the idea in mind that players could play in the same room on one computer without knowing the other playerâ€™s cards.</p>
        <br className="space-y-3"></br>
        <p>Cards are randomly imported into the hands of the players. </p>
        <br className="space-y-3"></br>
        <p>The player has the option to hit or pass each turn. </p>
        <br className="space-y-3"></br>
        <p>If a player goes over 21 or chooses to keep their hand, the next player now has the same choice. </p>
        <br className="space-y-3"></br>
        <p> If the last player goes over 21 or chooses to keep their hand, the game will go to a screen, which will show who wins and add a counter for who won.</p>
